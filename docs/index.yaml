    description: NimbusRun is an autoscaler for GitHub self-hosted runners that run
      on virtual machines (AWS, GCP, or your own compute engine). Unlike Kubernetes-only
      solutions, it brings elastic scaling to VM-based runners, including full scale-to-zero
      support to eliminate the “cloud idle tax.” With features such as dynamic autoscaling
      of GitHub Actions runners, support for multiple cloud providers or pluggable
      backends, retry logic for stuck jobs, and simple deployment via Helm, NimbusRun
      helps reduce idle compute, improve build efficiency, and prevent unexpected
      costs on your cloud bill.
