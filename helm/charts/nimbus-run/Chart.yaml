description: "NimbusRun is an autoscaler for GitHub self-hosted runners that run on VMs \n(AWS, GCP, or your own compute engine). Unlike Kubernetes-only solutions, \nNimbusRun brings the same elastic scaling to VM-based runners â€” including \nscale-to-zero support to save you from paying the \"cloud idle tax.\"  \n\nFeatures:\n  - Dynamic autoscaling of GitHub Actions runners\n  - Support for AWS, GCP, or pluggable compute backends\n  - Scale-to-zero for cost efficiency\n  - Retry logic for stuck jobs\n  - Deployable via Helm for easy Kubernetes integration\n\nIn short: less idle compute, more efficient builds, and fewer surprises \non your cloud bill.\n"
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.2.25
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
