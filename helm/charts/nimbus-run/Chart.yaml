  NimbusRun is an autoscaler for GitHub self-hosted runners that run on VMs 
  (AWS, GCP, or your own compute engine). Unlike Kubernetes-only solutions, 
  NimbusRun brings the same elastic scaling to VM-based runners â€” including 
  scale-to-zero support to save you from paying the "cloud idle tax."  

  Features:
    - Dynamic autoscaling of GitHub Actions runners
    - Support for AWS, GCP, or pluggable compute backends
    - Scale-to-zero for cost efficiency
    - Retry logic for stuck jobs
    - Deployable via Helm for easy Kubernetes integration

  In short: less idle compute, more efficient builds, and fewer surprises 
  on your cloud bill.
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.2.22
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
